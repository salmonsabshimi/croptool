# croptool
Python script for cropping PDF files based on a certain keyword 
Make sure pymupdf, pillow, pdf2image and pytesseract are installed

# Background
This script utilises Tesseract OCR (optical character recognition) to crop the pdf based on the keyword specified, in my script I had it specified as "Correct Answer" because I wanted to crop the questions to test myself.
